# Retro Space Shooter

Yes, another Retro Space Shooter. I'm using it as an "excuse" to learn **game development**

## Technical stuff

* Made with [LÃ–VE](http://www.love2d.org)
* Levels are procedurally generated (every game is a new game, starting from level 1)
* This is a WIP. It might never finish
